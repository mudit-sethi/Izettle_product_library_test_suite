# Izettle product library test suite

This project is to test REST endpoints for Discount in Izettle Product Library. 

API specification: https://products.izettletest.com/swagger#/

Tools Used:
- Rest assured (https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/GettingStarted#rest-assured) as a Java Client to test the endpoints. (My first attempt with Java REST test. Have done it with python before)
- Junit as a Test runner to Run the tests. 
- Hamcrest matcher to validate responses at few places.
